## Error messages / dialogs

sync-conflict = Only one copy of pgrep can sync at once. Please wait a few minutes, then try again.
sync-server-error = Your sync server encountered a problem. Please try again in a few minutes.
sync-client-too-old = Your pgrep version is too old. Please update to the latest version to continue syncing.

sync-must-wait-for-end = pgrep is currently syncing. Please wait for the sync to complete, then try again.
sync-confirm-empty-download = This device has no cards. Download from server?
sync-confirm-empty-upload = The server has no cards. Replace it with this device's collection?
sync-conflict-explanation =
    Your decks here and on the server differ in such a way that they can't be merged together, so it's necessary to overwrite the decks on one side with the decks from the other.
    
    If you choose download, pgrep will fetch the collection from the server, and any changes you have made on this device since the last sync will be lost.
    
    If you choose upload, pgrep will send this device's data to the server, and any changes that are waiting on the server will be lost.
    
    After all devices are in sync, future reviews and added cards can be merged automatically.
sync-conflict-explanation2 =
    There is a conflict between this device and your sync server. You must choose which version to keep:

    - Select **{ sync-download-from-ankiweb }** to replace the decks here with the server’s version. You will lose any changes made on this device since your last sync.
    - Select **{ sync-upload-to-ankiweb }** to overwrite the server’s version with the decks from this device, and delete any changes stored there.

    Once the conflict is resolved, syncing will work as usual.
